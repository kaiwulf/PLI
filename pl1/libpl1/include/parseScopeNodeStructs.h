/*
 * ScopeNode
 * ---------
 * 
 * Scope node is a bi-directional tree structure. Bi-directional in the sense
 * that scopes on the same level are handled a linked list (->next), and the
 * scopes within the current scope is maintained with a linked list (->head,->tail).
 * The containing scope node can be reached via ->parent.
 * 
 * When the parsing starts the scopeRoot variable is allocated and set to an 
 * empty ScopeNode. The scopeRoot contains all the scopes in the program.
 * This means that when '*process;' is met a new compilation unit starts, 
 * but it will share the same scopeRoot. 
 * 
 * Looking ahead....
 * Another usage of the scopeRoot, is to 'attach' all the built-in functions 
 * and defaults at this very first level. Then all other scopes will inherit 
 * the definitions from the root level. This would even make user defined
 * compiler defaults very easy to implement.
 *
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * a0: proc options(main);
 *   a0_1: entry;
 *   b1: proc;
 *      c2:proc;
 *      end c2;
 *      d2: proc;
 *      end d2;
 *   end b1;
 * end a0; 
 * 
 *               tail,
 *  -----------  head  --------------  next
 * ! scopeRoot ! ---> ! ScopeNode A0 ! ---> null
 *  -----------        --------------
 *                           ! 
 *                           ! head,tail
 *                           V
 *                     --------------
 *                    ! ScopeNode B1 !
 *                     --------------
 *                           ! 
 *                           ! head . . . . . . . . tail
 *                           V                      V
 *                     --------------  next  --------------  next
 *                    ! ScopeNode C2 ! ---> ! ScopeNode D2 ! ---> null
 *                     --------------        --------------
 *                           !                      !
 *                           ! head,tail            ! head,tail
 *                           V                      V
 *                         null                   null
 *
 * 
 * Traversing the tree
 * -------------------
 * 
 * The recommended way to traverse the tree width first:
 * 	 traverseScopeTree(scopeRoot);
 * 
 * and use this as a skeleton for the traverse function 
 *    void traverseScopeTree(struct ScopeNode *current)
 *		{ struct ScopeNode *work;
 *		  /-* width first *-/
 *		  for(work=current;work;work=work->next)
 *		  { processNode(work);
 *		  }
 *		  /-* now recurse into the sub tree for the children for each node. *-/
 *		  for(work=current;work;work=work->next)
 *		  { traverseScopeTree(work->head);
 *		  }
 *		}
 * 
 * 
 *
